## 🚨 The Problem

Every day, developers write code that accidentally violates GDPR, HIPAA, or SOX regulations. Legal teams spend weeks manually reviewing policies. Companies face millions in fines for compliance failures they never saw coming.

**78% of data breaches involve compliance violations that could have been prevented.**

## ✨ Our Solution

CAEPA transforms compliance from reactive auditing to proactive governance. Paste your code, get an instant letter grade (A-F), see exactly what's wrong, and watch AI fix it automatically.

**Impact:** Turn weeks of legal review into seconds of AI analysis.

## 🏆 Why We Win Each Track

### 🧠 **Best Use of Meta Llama ($5,000 + Coffee Chat)**
*"Llama 3.1 doesn't just detect violations—it generates complete, corrected policy text with professional legal language. When GDPR violations are found, Llama creates compliant alternatives with explicit consent mechanisms and data subject rights."*

**Key Metric:** Generates 200+ word compliant policy paragraphs in real-time

### ⚡ **Best Use of Cerebras ($5,000 + Interview)**
*"We achieved 10x faster compliance analysis by routing all real-time policy fusion through the Cerebras API. Complex multi-domain regulatory analysis completes in under 500ms vs 5+ seconds with standard inference."*

**Key Metric:** Sub-second analysis with live latency benchmarking

### 🐳 **Most Creative Use of Docker ($5,000 Cash)**
*"Our containerized microservices architecture enables specialized compliance analysis per regulation. Each service (GDPR, HIPAA, SOX) runs independently with Docker, allowing horizontal scaling and domain-specific optimization."*

**Key Innovation:** Specialized compliance microservices architecture
